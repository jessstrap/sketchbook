(Source code for popcorn time
+ webtorrent (link)
+ web rtc signalling (link) ) 
x browserfy
x some dev work
= popcorn time in the browser. 

could be distributed via sneakernet but must be used online.
only needs public web rtc singling bootstrap servers. 
also needs torrent indexer services. 
    should use legalTorrents.com (link) and internetArchive by default. should also allow users to add other search api providers or enter their own magnet urls. 

using existing bit torrent requires technical competence, downloading and running untrusted software, and navigating the greyweb. 
using existing popcorn time requrires running untrusted software. 
popcorn time in the browser only requires running an app in a browser. 

essentially butter project in the browser.
