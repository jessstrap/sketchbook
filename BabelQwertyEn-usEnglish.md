qwerty/en-us keyboard layout
English language phonemes. 

Only the qwerty en-us layout for the English language speakers is detailed here. The construction of similar constructed languages in the same family to serve other languages should be simple.
For ease of of learning the mapping of syllables to keys syllables are broken out into a 2 dimensional matrix by vowel sound and consonant sound and mapped to keys by the horizontal and vertical location of the keys on the qwerty keyboard.

# Layout
[Here](BabelQwertyEn-usEnglishLayoutTable.md) is a a table of key name, notational name, English phonetic spelling, IPA phonetic spelling.

# Current ordering 
## Vowels: top to bottom: Name (Notation) &lt;English phonetic spelling&rt;. Ordered by alphabetical location then by long before short
    - Long A.  (A) &lt;ay&rt;
    - Short A. (a) &lt;ah&rt;
    - Long E.  (E) &lt;ee&rt;
    - Short E. (e) &lt;eh&rt;
    - Long I.  (I) &lt;eye&rt;
    - Short I. (i) &lt;ih&rt;
    - Long O.  (O) &lt;oh&rt;
    - Short O. (o) &lt;oo&rt;
    - Short U. (u) &lt;uh&rt;
    - Skipped
        - Long U due to its similarities with short O.
        - Y as a vowel due to its similarities with I, and e.
            
## Consonants: left to right on keyboard: Notation (Notes). ordered by alphabetical location.
    - B
    - C (pronounced as 'Ch'. (Charles.) Hard c (cage) conflicts with K. Soft c (Celia) conflicts with s.)
    - D
    - F
    - G (G is always hard (Gate). Soft G (George) conflicts with J )
    - H
    - J
    - K
    - L
    - M
    - N
    - P
    - R
    - S
    - T
    - V 
    - W
    - Z
    - Skipped:
        - Q because Pronunciation is composite of K and W or K and Y
        - X Conflicts with Z or K and S. 
        - Y Could be used but is made confusing by vowel Y and not really needed

        - The release sylable repeated twice cancels the record phrase and leaves it in listening mode.
        - The default phrase suggested in documentation should be 'listen to me &lt;speaker name&rt; &lt;device name&rt;'
        - If used on a device with a screen the screen should display the wakeup phrase.
        - Examples 
            - 'boo listenen to me jessstrap phone BooBoo' pauses listening. 
            - 'The wakeup phrase is listenen to me jessstrap phone Boo and then Boo' would not restart listening.
            - 'listenen to me jessstrap phone BooBoo' restarts listening.
            - 'boo the fans say boo to me BooBoo' would pause listening
            - 'the fans say boo to me BooBoo' restarts listening.'
            - 'boo listen to me Whoops! AAAAAAAAAA! It Burns It Burns! hoohoo' does not pause listening.
