Use a user generated content q+a/reputation/gamified site to provide search/discovery/suggestions for magnet links for torrents. See if you can buy/licence the source from stackexchange. 
The site is strictly for magnets to torrents with content that is legal to redistribute in the US. If possible the site should be open source and easily cloned so other sites could be made supporting other content categories. Other sites could include company private videos, company leased videos, content legal in other jurisdictions (such as those with very lax copyright law).
The answer format should have additional fields for the magnet link itself, copyright info, licence info, legal jurisdiction restrictions, subtitle information, language track information, author/owner contact info, for use with filtering and on search apis.
The site should have a machine speaking search api. (May require user to submit payment via ProofOWApi)
The site should have an embedable search subsite. This search subsite may include adds or other monitization. This subsite should provide a way for an embedder to extract the currently selected answers special fields. Something like PopcornTimeBrowser could use this to allow a user to find a torrent, then read out the information to show the user their content. 

This site could be backed by the internet archive. 
This site plus browserPopcornTime could be used to replace the internet archives current video serving system. 
should work as a butter project server.
